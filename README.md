This is a DEMO of a iOS app that uses parse.com as the back-end.

I have created this app to help my University students to better understand iOS ViewControllers, animations and network usage.

The code is fully commented to better address the reasons for those actions.

Steps:

1 - Create your account with parse.com (free) and be sure to leave "Allow client class creation" set to YES

2 - Get the ApplicationID and ClientKey and set them on AppDelegate.m

You are ready to go, enjoy!
